The rage of Peleus' son, the direful springOf all the Grecian woes, O Goddess, sing! That wrath which hurl'd to Pluto's gloomy reign. The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain; Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore, Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore. Since great Achilles and Atrides strove, Such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove! Declare, O Muse, in what ill-fated hour Sprung the fierce strife, from what offended power? Latona's son a dire contagion spread, And heap'd the camp with mountains of the dead; the king of men his reverend priest defied, And for the king's offence the people died. For Chryses sought, with costly gifts to gain His captive daughter from the victor's chain. Suppliant the venerable father stands; Apollo's awful emblems grace his hands: By these he begs; and lowly bending down, Extends the sceptre and the laurel crown.The low petition, gracious to attendThe Greeks' great monarch, and the Greeks' offend. He said; the rage of Agamemnon burns; The trembling priest the stern reply returns."Hence! clamours he, nor dare in this disguiseSue for thy daughter with those impious eyes. The slave, the prize of this victorious hand, Shall not be touch'd, till all her ransom paid, Till time has quell'd the fierce Atrides' rage, And age and honours bid his heart assuage. Begone! this instant from our site remove, Nor tempt too far the vengeance of my Jove. "The passage describes the opening scene of the Iliad, where Chryses, a priest of Apollo, comes to the Greek camp to ransom his daughter, who has been captured. When Agamemnon, the king of the Greeks, refuses to release her, Apollo sends a plague upon the Greek army. This leads to a confrontation between Agamemnon and Achilles, the greatest Greek warrior, which sets the stage for the events of the epic.
